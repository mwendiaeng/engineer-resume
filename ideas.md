# Resume Design Ideas for Peter Mwendia

<response>
<text>
**Design Movement**: Swiss Modernism meets Digital Brutalism

**Core Principles**:
- Radical simplicity with bold, oversized typography
- Asymmetric grid system with deliberate negative space
- Monochromatic palette with strategic accent color
- Raw, unpolished edges that convey authenticity

**Color Philosophy**: 
Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) as primary background, crisp white (#ffffff) for text, and a single electric accent—vibrant cyan (#00d9ff)—used sparingly for critical information like contact details and section dividers. The restraint creates visual hierarchy through contrast alone.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Break the traditional resume grid entirely. Use a bold left sidebar (40% width) for name and contact, with content flowing in an irregular, staggered column on the right. Section headers are massive (80-100px) and positioned to create visual anchors.

**Signature Elements**:
- Oversized numerical indicators for sections (01, 02, 03) in ultra-light weight
- Thick horizontal rules (8px) that don't span full width, creating visual tension
- Monospaced font for technical skills to emphasize developer identity

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Minimal but purposeful. Hover states reveal subtle cyan underlines. Smooth scroll with snap points to sections. No unnecessary animations—every motion serves navigation.

**Animation**: 
Section headers fade in with slight upward drift (20px, 0.6s ease-out) on scroll. Skill tags have staggered entrance (0.1s delay between each). Contact links pulse gently on hover (scale 1.05, 0.2s).

**Typography System**: 
- Display: Space Grotesk Bold (name, section headers)
- Body: Inter Regular (descriptions, dates)
- Technical: JetBrains Mono (skills, code-related content)
Hierarchy through size contrast: 72px → 48px → 16px → 14px

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism with Playful Energy

**Core Principles**:
- Bold, chunky borders and shadows for depth
- Vibrant, high-contrast color blocking
- Intentional "imperfection" with slight rotations and offsets
- Confident, friendly personality through design choices

**Color Philosophy**: 
Warm cream background (#faf8f3) as the canvas, deep forest green (#1a3a2e) for primary text, burnt orange (#e85d04) for accents, and soft sage (#8db596) for secondary elements. The palette feels organic yet energetic—professional but approachable, perfect for a developer who values both craft and collaboration.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Card-based sections with thick borders (4px solid) and pronounced shadows (8px offset, 0.3 opacity). Each section is a distinct "block" with slight rotation (-1° to 2°) to break rigidity. Content flows in a single column on mobile, two-column masonry on desktop.

**Signature Elements**:
- Chunky pill-shaped tags for skills with thick borders and shadows
- Hand-drawn style divider lines (SVG with slight irregularity)
- Bold section labels in all-caps with letter-spacing, positioned at 45° angle in corner

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Playful without being childish. Hover on cards increases shadow depth and rotation. Skill tags "pop" forward on hover (scale 1.1, rotate 3°). Smooth transitions (0.3s cubic-bezier) make interactions feel bouncy.

**Animation**: 
Cards enter with a "drop-in" effect (translateY(-30px) + rotate(5°) → 0, 0.5s ease-out). Skills animate in as a wave (0.05s stagger). Scroll-triggered parallax on background elements (subtle, 0.2x speed).

**Typography System**: 
- Display: Outfit ExtraBold (name, section headers)
- Body: DM Sans Regular (content, descriptions)
- Accent: Outfit Medium (dates, labels)
Strong hierarchy through weight and size: 64px bold → 24px medium → 16px regular

**Design Movement**: Contemporary Minimalism with Editorial Elegance

**Core Principles**:
- Generous whitespace and breathing room
- Refined typography with careful hierarchy
- Subtle gradients and soft shadows for depth
- Sophisticated color palette that feels premium

**Color Philosophy**: 
Soft off-white (#f8f9fa) background with warm undertones, deep navy (#1e2a3a) for primary text, muted gold (#d4a574) for accents, and cool gray (#6b7280) for secondary information. The palette evokes trust, professionalism, and quiet confidence—ideal for a backend developer applying to an international AgriTech company.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Generous margins (10-15% on sides) with content in a centered, narrow column (max 720px). Sections separated by ample vertical space (120px). Key information (name, role) positioned in upper third with dramatic whitespace below.

**Signature Elements**:
- Delicate hairline dividers (1px, 20% opacity) that span only 60% width
- Soft gradient overlays on section backgrounds (linear, 2° opacity shift)
- Small, elegant serif numbers for dates in muted gold

**Interaction Philosophy**: 
Refined and understated. Hover states reveal soft glow effects (box-shadow blur). Links underline with elegant slide-in animation. No jarring movements—everything feels intentional and calm.

**Animation**: 
Fade-in with slight blur reduction (filter: blur(4px) → 0, 0.8s ease-out) on scroll. Section headers have a subtle "reveal" with clip-path. Skill items fade in sequentially (0.08s stagger, opacity 0 → 1).

**Typography System**: 
- Display: Playfair Display SemiBold (name)
- Headers: Lora Medium (section titles)
- Body: Source Sans Pro Regular (content)
- Accent: Source Sans Pro SemiBold (labels, emphasis)
Elegant hierarchy: 56px serif → 32px serif → 18px sans → 16px sans
